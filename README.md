# PATH-PLANNING-OF-AN-AUTONOMOUS-OBSTACLE-AVOIDING-VEHICLE

The goal of this project was to create a system that will be capable to understand its location
by using both odometry and Inertial Measurement Unit ( IMU ). Moreover, the vehicle should
be capable of planning its path, that is performed by using already created and known map.
Furthermore, sonar sensors attached to all physical corners of the vehicle should track
placement of potential obstacles that can be intentionally created, and avoid them by using
basic principle of obstacle avoidance.

Equipment Used: Raspberry PI, Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor Hat, Bosch BNO055 (IMU), Ender 3 Pro, Nema 14 35HY34 and ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04.
